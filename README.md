# prolog
distributed transaction logger - based off work by Travis Jeffery from book "Distributed Services with Go"

to code is copy+pasted from https://github.com/travisjeffery/proglog with small edits here and there

I read a chapter and then integrate the code from the aforementioned repo (sometimes it doesn't line up perfectly)

I plan on using the experience learned here to build my own distributed systems for both fun and profit.
